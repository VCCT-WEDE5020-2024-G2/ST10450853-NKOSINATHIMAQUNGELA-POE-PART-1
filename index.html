        <h2>What we offer</h2>
    </u>

    <p> We offer the people of Cape Town, that have been affected by
        natural disasters, emergency services, shelter, and the knowledge they need
        to be prepared for any disasters. Many homes throughout the Western Province have succumed 
        to the brutal forces of nature, and many of the people that were affected, do not have the finances to
        start afresh. This is why we offer them shelter at many of our locations throughout Cape Town.
    </p>
